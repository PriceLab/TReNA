Gene regulation via transcription factor binding, leading to transcription and translation, plays a
crucial role in the regulation of many gene processes.  Gene regulation plays the central role both
in physiological responses in terminally differentiated cells, and in controlling cell fate in 
differentiation.

Actual regulatory processes in eukaryotic cells are complex and dynamic - involving simple TF
binding, co-factors which do not bind DNA, DNA binding sometimes determined more by DNA shape than
DNA sequence, chromatin architecture, dosage effects and stochasticity.  Despite recent progress in
single-cell assays, and cell sorting (CyTOF, for example), we will work with incomplete information
for these processes for many years to come.

The trena software package provides a spectrum of analytical approaches with which to predict gene
regulatory relationships using fine-grained data when it is available, yet it can also provide
insight when such data is lacking.  trena's most basic, minimal data strategy simply reports which
regulatory genes are correlated or anti-correlated in gene expression to a target gene.  trena's
most nuanced strategy uses time series scATAC-seq, tissue-specific RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, enhancers, and
flexible motif and DNA shape matching algorithms.  trena will incorporate new assays and data type
as they emerge.

trena has two stages.  The first consists of many different strategies for selecting
candidate transcription factors from among the ~1500 described in the human geneome (footnote GO).
In the degenerate case, no selection is made: all TFs are considered.  More commonly we query a
database of tissue-specific DNASE I footprints (footnote: Cory's paper).  Recently we have used
scATAC-seq over a differentiation timecourse.   An example of each of these will be presented below.

The second stage runs a (growing) collection of mostly linear feature selecting algorithms to detect
relationships in gene expression between the transcription factor genes produced by stage one, and
the target gene whose regulation is being modeled.

We have evolved a suite of "trena ecosystem" software tools and data resources, mostly within the
Bioconductor project.  These include public databases of tissue-specific DNASE I footprints, MotifDb
(a compendium of TF motifs from many sources), a javascript genome browser (igvR) connected to an R
programming session which provides indispensable visualization of regulatory regions, motif
matching, and gene models.  trena may be run on the web via a multi-faceted shiny app, trenaViz.
Docker images are provided for human, mouse and a few other model systems.

In the three examples (all of which may be run interactively as trenaViz shiny apps on the web) we
demonstrate the use of trena with three levels of data:

  1) establish that SPI1 regulates TREM2 in neocortex (using DNASE footprints to constrain
     possible binding sites)
  2) identify a possible cofactor with no motif (the degenerate case, in which no constraints
     are provided on TFs)
  3) propose a novel regulator of GATA2 in erythropiesis, using scATAC-seq and bulk RNA
  
Some unorganized notes:

Motif matching often plays a role in predicting gene regulation.   Mariam working with me will
produce data for a section of the paper, showing (we think) that a strict match threshold misses
important binding events.  She does this by finding motif matching scores in high quality ChIP-seq.

Jocelyn recommends 4 papers (all out of the stam lab?) c 2012, which among other things establish
that solid ChIP-seq in prime regulatory regions are at least sometimes non-functional.   This is
part of my account of the "trena gambit" to include in the paper somehow, maybe only implicitly:

  - actual TF binding does not reliably predict functional regulation
  - motif matching is necessary (sort of, see Mariam's project above, and see recent flurry
    of papers and software on DNA shape "binding") but has huge FDR.
  - combining these two with progressively more specific information, with tissue specificity
    and single-cell data, of chromatin architecture, starts to get truly useful.

gene regulation plays an important role in deterimining cell state.  since cell state is an intensely
dynamic process, either to establish and maintan equilibiriu, or to differentiate into successive
states, so therefor muse gene regulation be a highly dynamic process.

Historical limiations ni determining ro prediction gene gegulatory relationships have been loosened
recently due to the incresing availability of ChIP-se, scATAC-seq, RNA-seq, single-cell
transcriptomics, SRM, epigenomics and proteomics.  These assays open up dynamic apsects of cell
state permitting (enabling) inference and deduction of gene regulation with ever-incresing
fidelity, producing candidate regulatory relationships worthy of attempts at laboratory validation.
of course many cell types, differentiation trajectories, tissues and organisms cannot yet be assayed
in such fine detail.

any boradly useful computational tool to elucidate gene regulatory relatinships should support
information densisty at all points along this spectrum, from simple static data (e.g., buk RNA,
static genome sequence and generic promoter definition) to multi-dimensional and
multi-stage/timepoint measurements of gene expression, protein counts and chomatin modification.

the trena software package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/trena.html)
addresses this spectur of analytical possibilities, as we will demonstrate in successive sections of
this paper.

Let us begin with some observations.  to a first approximation, eukaryotic gene regulation depends

- upon the presence in the nucleues of protein transcription factors
- open chromatin
- binding partners, either DNA or other protein factors and co-factors
- the recruitment of transcription machiner to the target genes' TSS by some combination of TFs and
- co-factors

In its simplest mode ofoperation, trena uses only bulk gene expression data, which serves as a proxy
for TF protein abundance;  a generically defined promoter region (a proxy for gene- and
cell-state-specific open chromatin in promoters and enhancers); and high-scoring motif matching fo
these TFs to promoter sequence.

In its (current) most nuanced operation we use scATAC-seq to identifies stage-specific open chromatin, 
cell-type specific RNA-seq backed up by sc proteomics (SRM) to provide TF abundance, and a
combinaton of DNA sequence & DNA shape matching, cross-references to ChIP-seq, intersected with
cell- or tissue-type specific HiC, eqtl and enhancer expression.

Trena has two well-separated, independetn stages which handily supports this broad spectrum of
information density.

The first stage selects candidate TFs
The scond stage uses a variety of well-established feature selection regression (or regression-like)
algorithms operating on gene expression, to idenify from among the TFs identified in stage one,
those TFs whose quantities are correlated or anti-correlated with that of the target gene.   This
stage operates upon quantitative expression data.  Among the mostly linear feature selectors are
spearman and pearson correlation, lasso, ridge, random forest, XGBoost.  The net result of this
ensemble of "solvers" is a table of scores, per TF per method, of those TFs whose motifs match DNA
sequence in teh designated regulatory region of th etarget gene, however defined.  This table
provides candidate TFs pointed to by two orthogonal kinds of evidence: co-expression, probability of
binding, for closer examination and possibly attempts at laboratory validation.

A degenerate verions of stage one - candidate TF selction - can also be useful.  We sometimes choose
the full set of GO:00037000 "DNA-binding transcription factor activity" annotated genes as
candidates for feature selection, almost half of which have no associated DNA-binding motif.  This
degernerate maximally simple strategy will sometimes suggest co-facts not otherwise avaialble for
scruting which, if correlated or anti-correlated in gene expression, will emerge as high-ranked
regulatory candiations in stage two.

transcription factor binding leading to subsequent gene transcription and translation play a crucial
role in the regulation of many gene processes.  It is, at present, incompletely understood.  to a
first approximation however TF binding can be characterized by judicious combination of data from three assays: 
of gene exspression, of DNA sequence, and of open chromatin.
presence of transcription factor proteins in the nucleus of the cell, which have a reasonable match
in open chromatin to the DNA sequence of the TFs' cognate binding motif, in chromosomal regions
proximal to the target gene's transcription start site.  Though actual regulatory processes in
metazoans are complex and dynamicm - involving co-factors which do not bind DNA, direct binding
guided more by DNA shape than DNA sequence, epigenetics and pervasive stochasticity - the trena
software package provides a spectrum of analytical approaches, with which to predict gene regulatory
relationships.  the most basic strategy reports which genes annotatedas regulatory are correlated or
anti-correlated in gene expression to a target gene.  At present, the most nuanced strategy uses

Nonetheless, significant insight into the dynamics of gene regulation can be obtained from data
readily available today, and with the increasingly specific data likely to come.

The trena software package combines established computational techniques to predict gene regulatory

combine to Specifically  - several regression methods
for feature selection, and motif-matching producing unexpected
accuracy in reproducing known gene regulatory relationships and predicting new ones.  Neither transcription
factor/target gene mRNA or protein co-expression, nor high quality ChIP-seq assays in themselves indicate actual gene
regulation.  In the "trena gambit", we combine various instances of these computational methods and/or assays (gene
activity, sequence matching) to create single gene and whole genome regulatory models.  The weakest form of this
combination is bulk RNA tf/tg co-expression, and tf motif matching in an unverified "classical" promoter region, +2000,
-500 bp of the tg's TSS.  In a stronger (and increasingly available) form, tissue- and or celltype-speciric RNA-seq is
combined with single-cell, stage specific ATAC-seq to predict the shifting regulation of target genes under varying
conditions or across a time series.

Gene regulation is intrinsically dynamic.  Experimental data 

the discernment of gene regulatory relationships is a computational
challenege that will not soon end.  Software can assist in this
discernment and the ideal software for the task will

 - offer standard versions of algorithms which will be used   long-lasting
 - support easy addition incorporation of new algorithms and (especially) new kinds of data

these principles have guided the design of trena
